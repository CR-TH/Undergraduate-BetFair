#####Purpose

---
This repository contains code that I used for my Undergraduate Project titled 'Who will win the Tennis/Football/Cricket'. The idea was to attempt to predict events in sports games from changes in various markets odds over time.

---
The project contains code that was used to extract betting odds from the BetFair API over the period of a sports game and a GUI to analyse odds as they came in to attempt to predict any events that have occurred from changes in the odds.

---
The code is all old and has been stripped to remove API keys/passwords and other unneeded information. The repository has been uploaded just as a reference point to compare myself against. Unfortunately it won't run but it's something to look at :). I may try to make it more presentable in the future I'd bet that the BetFair API has changed significantly and there's a lot more I'd want to do.
